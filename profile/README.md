# Moved to Codeberg

This organization has been moved to https://codeberg.org/TrytonDACH.

Github/Microsoft's Copilot is not respecting the license of our code. This is nothing but sweating for FOSS developers and capitalistic accumulation of commons. For more information about this topic please see https://www.fsf.org/licensing/copilot/.

We are looking forward for you contributions at Codeberg. Codeberg is a democratic community-driven, non-profit software development platform operated by Codeberg e.V. and centered around [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/), a Gitea-based software forge.
